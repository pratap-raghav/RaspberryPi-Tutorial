## Introduction

This repository is aimed at anyone interested in learning about the Raspberry Pi and how to interface it with various sensors and peripherals. Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate user, these tutorials will give you practical experience with hardware and software interaction using the Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorials, ensure you have the following:

- A Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS installed
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Access to a terminal and SSH (optional)
- Required sensors and components as mentioned in the respective project sections

### Required Libraries

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed on your Raspberry Pi:

- `RPi.GPIO`
- `time`
- `smbus`
- `RPLCD`
- `adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15`
- `mfrc522`

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install RPLCD adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15 mfrc522 smbus
```

## Project List

### LDR with ADS1115

- **Description:** This project demonstrates how to use an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) with the ADS1115 ADC to read light intensity and control an LED based on the light level.
- **Components:**
  - LDR
  - ADS1115 ADC
  - LED

### RFID Authentication System

- **Description:** This tutorial guides you through building an RFID authentication system. Upon scanning a valid RFID tag, the system will open a door or perform a specific action, such as lighting up an LED.
- **Components:**
  - MFRC522 RFID Module
  - RFID tags/cards
  - LED

### IR Sensor Obstacle Detection

- **Description:** Learn how to use an IR sensor for detecting obstacles. When an object is detected, an LED lights up, and the system displays a message on an LCD.
- **Components:**
  - IR Sensor
  - LED
  - LCD Display

### Ultrasonic Distance Measurement

- **Description:** This project shows how to measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor. The distance will be displayed on an LCD, and an LED will light up when the distance is within a predefined range.
- **Components:**
  - Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
  - LED
  - LCD Display

### RTC Time Display

- **Description:** Set up and use an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module to keep accurate time. The time will be displayed on an LCD, and the system will update the time every second.
- **Components:**
  - DS3231 RTC Module
  - LCD Display

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this Repository

First, clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/raspberry-pi-tutorials.git
cd raspberry-pi-tutorials
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have all the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install RPLCD adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15 mfrc522 smbus
```

### 3. Wiring the Components

Each project requires specific wiring for the sensors and peripherals. Please refer to the individual project folders for detailed wiring diagrams.

### 4. Run the Projects

Each tutorial has its Python script. To run a specific project, navigate to its folder and run the Python script:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```

## Usage

Each project includes step-by-step instructions, code explanations, and wiring diagrams to ensure you can follow along easily. The code is designed to be simple and modular, making it easy to understand and modify for your own applications.

### Example:

For the **RFID Authentication System**, place an RFID tag near the reader. If the tag is recognized, the system will output the RFID ID and turn on the LED.
